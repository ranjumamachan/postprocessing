# Solar Panel Irradiation Correlation Analysis

## 📊 Project Description
This Python script performs statistical analysis and visualization of solar panel irradiation data, specifically comparing the performance of two panels (Panel A and Panel B) over a measurement period. The code generates a scatter plot with linear regression to analyze the correlation between the two panels' irradiation readings.

## 🔬 Scientific Context
The analysis is designed for solar energy research, examining how consistently two different solar panels measure irradiation levels. This type of analysis is crucial for:
- Validating sensor accuracy in solar monitoring systems
- Identifying performance discrepancies between panels
- Quality control in solar energy installations
- Environmental monitoring applications

## ⚙️ Technical Features
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Uses `scipy.stats.linregress` to calculate the relationship between Panel A and Panel B measurements
- **Professional Visualization**: Implements publication-quality plotting with matplotlib
- **Statistical Metrics**: Computes correlation coefficient, p-value, and standard error
- **Clean Aesthetics**: Custom styling with grid lines, spine removal, and consistent formatting

## 📈 Key Outputs
- Scatter plot comparing Panel A vs Panel B irradiation values
- Linear regression line showing the correlation trend
- Statistical parameters (slope, intercept, R-value) for quantitative analysis
- High-resolution PNG image suitable for publications and reports

## 🛠️ Dependencies
```python
matplotlib >= 3.5.0
numpy >= 1.21.0
scipy >= 1.7.0
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Replace the `panel_a` and `panel_b` arrays with your own irradiation data
2. Run the script to generate the correlation analysis
3. The plot is automatically saved as `styled_regression_plot.png`

## 📝 Data Format
Input data should be numpy arrays of floating-point values representing irradiation measurements in consistent units (W/m² or equivalent).

## 🔍 Applications
- Solar panel performance monitoring
- Sensor calibration validation
- Renewable energy research
- Environmental data analysis
- Quality assurance in solar installations
