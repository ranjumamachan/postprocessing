Certainly! Here’s a clear description you can use in your GitHub repo, including a note about the current limitation regarding outlier handling:

### Description

This script processes and visualizes temperature data from multiple Excel files. It is designed for batch processing of files in a specified input directory, matching a given filename pattern (e.g., `"day 2 *.xlsx"`). The script performs the following steps:

1. **File Discovery & Loading:**  
   Scans the input directory for all Excel files that match the specified pattern. Each file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Datetime Construction:**  
   Combines the 'Date:' and 'Time:' columns from each file to create a unified `DateTime` column for time-series analysis.

3. **Temperature Data Cleaning:**  
   For selected channels (`Channel - 1` to `Channel - 5` and `Channel - 11` to `Channel - 15`), the script:
   - Converts data to numeric types.
   - Applies lower and upper thresholds (e.g., 30°C to 85°C) to filter out invalid readings.
   - **Note:** The script does _not_ currently detect or remove outlier temperature values that fall far from the mean within the valid range. Spurious spikes or drops within the threshold bounds may still be present in the results.

4. **Data Combination:**  
   All cleaned DataFrames from the files are concatenated and sorted by timestamp.

5. **Plotting:**  
   - **Panel 1:** Plots temperature data for channels 1–5.
   - **Panel 2:** Plots temperature data for channels 11–15.
   - Both panels share an x-axis formatted to display time only and are output to a high-resolution PNG file.

6. **Output:**  
   The resulting plot is saved to a designated output directory, and a success message is printed.

#### Limitations and Notes

- **Outlier Handling:**  
  The script filters data based on fixed thresholds, but **does not exclude values that, while within the threshold, deviate significantly from the mean or expected pattern**. If the datasets contain anomalous temperature spikes or drops within the 30–85°C range, these will still be included in the plots.
- **Assumptions:**  
  - Input Excel files must contain 'Date:', 'Time:', and the relevant channel columns.
  - The script expects a consistent file structure and column naming.

This script is useful for quickly visualizing and comparing temperature trends across multiple channels and files, but may require further statistical filtering if robust outlier exclusion is needed.
